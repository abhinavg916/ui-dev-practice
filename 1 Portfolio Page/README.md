## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS

## Challenges

- Is it good to add padding/margin to anchor tag inside of `li` or on the `li` itself in Navbar?
- When adding an empty space on top in a Navbar by design, which approach is better either padding or margin?
- How to make equal column width in grid container
- How to make a horizontal line as a inline element by design without the use of `hr` tag?
- Designing common shapes using CSS like Hamburger, Arrows (Left, Right, Up, Down), etc
- How to apply CSS effects only intermediate between elements, not on first and last child from a parent element using pseudo selectors in CSS (nth-child(), not(), etc)?
- How to add gaps only between the cards like in grid gap but not all around?

## Improvements

- Use BEM Methodology for naming classes
- Always start with thinking about the layout structure of the HTML
- Write the complete HTML first then CSS
